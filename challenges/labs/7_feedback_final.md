## Feedback

Change the ratio between theory and hands-on work:

* Experienced admins can work around issues on their own
* Learning effect of dealing with differences on various OS's, etc. are minimal
* Learning how to do a repetitive tasks faster may not be true goal of a training

Liked the scope of the training
* Particularly the focus on security and how to set it up
* Liked practical advice on several issues
* Hue part may not be necessary, since most people are probably familiar with it.
